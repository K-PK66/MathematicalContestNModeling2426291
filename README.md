It is near the desperation that locates my situation when I decided to participate in the contest as the last dance. Many tough circumstances ought to be met before I am entitled to gain admission to master's degree studies without entrance examinations, so I took the experience only as enjoyment.

There are almost none of the people in my social coverage want to team up with me, as they have dived into their papers for graduation and I have to struggle for another single year since I have been threatened to suspend my studies by the school due to my bad words on the corrupt and foolish decisions drafted by the officers. However, a slight shed of light cast on me when a roommate of mine invited me to join the team of his girlfriend, as they initially planned to team up with a girl from another college (though I don't know the name of the college) but failed according to limitations of our school. I accepted the invitation and, thankfully, finally got the team to finish my last dance.

I joined the same contest in 2021 and 2022 as a leader of another team but only got an Honorable Mention Prize and a Successful Participant Prize respectively. It's acceptable for readers to say that it is OK when we get the H award, but it is devastating to receive the S award 1 year later as it can be taken as nothing. To protect myself and my teammates from similar stories, I stayed at school for additional days after the final exams and the term they terminated. Libraries across Xi'an were hot places I visited at that time only in pursuit of more tips when writing the solution papers.

The contest started near the Lunar New Year, the time when I had been home already due to conventions. The youngsters kept in touch with me online so I could reach them to clarify some confusions regarding details they had given in their analysis outputs. We sent our solutions 12 hours earlier than required, and we, later on, stayed tuned to the results.

The results are scheduled to be announced on May 10th, 2024, but we received the results a week earlier. All of us are excited to win the Meritorious Winner Award this year, as they are the first time to be participants and I find myself progressive. It was a remarkable moment, and I want to express my gratitude to my teammate and, of course, the roommate who introduced me to the team. It would be hard to strike out such a symphony without our joint efforts.

Feel free to take the paper as a reference.

当我决定将本次美赛作为最后一舞的时候我的处境已经非常不妙了。报名时在我和推免读研之间依然隔着很多的障碍，因此这次参赛我一点压力也没有，纯在享受。

在我的社交范围内，几乎没有人愿意与我合作，因为他们都在忙着准备毕业论文，而我由于对学校官员的腐败和愚蠢决定恶语相向，被学校威胁停学，不得不再在学校留一年。然而，我的室友邀请我加入他女朋友的团队，这给我带来了一丝曙光，因为他们最初计划与另一所学院（虽然我不知道学院的名字）的一名女生组队，但由于学校的有关要求限制而无疾而终。我接受了邀请，也终于找到了最终的归宿。

我在2021年和2022年作为另一个团队的领队参加了同一比赛，但只分别获得了Honorable Mention和Successful Participant。对于读者来说，拿到H奖还可以接受，但一年后拿到S奖就很崩溃了，因为可能会被认为一无所获。为了防止类似的事情重演，我在期末考试和学期结束后在学校多留了几天。当时，西安各地的图书馆都是我常去的地方，只为寻求更多的解题技巧。

比赛开始时临近农历新年，那时我因为中华传统已经回家了。两位学妹/弟在网上与我保持联系，这样我就可以随时向他们就分析结果中给出的细节方面的一些困惑展开询问，从而提升我的写作效率。我们比要求的时间提前了12个小时发送了我们的解决方案，之后我们一直关注着结果。

结果定于2024年5月10日公布，但我们提前一周收到了结果。我们所有人都为获得了Meritorious Winner而激动不已，因为他们是第一次参赛，而我虽然是最后一次参赛但还是证明了自己状态没有下滑。这是一个非凡的时刻，我要向我的队友，当然还有介绍我加入团队的室友表示感谢。没有我们的共同努力，很难有如今的结果。
