It is near the desperation that locates my situation when I decided to participate in the contest as the last dance. Many tough circumstances ought to be met before I am entitled to gain admission to master's degree studies without entrance examinations, so I took the experience only as enjoyment.

There are almost none of the people in my social coverage want to team up with me, as they have dived into their papers for graduation and I have to struggle for another single year since I have been threatened to suspend my studies by the school due to my bad words on the corrupt and foolish decisions drafted by the officers. However, a slight shed of light cast on me when a roommate of mine invited me to join the team of his girlfriend, as they initially planned to team up with a girl from another college (though I don't know the name of the college) but failed according to limitations of our school. I accepted the invitation and, thankfully, finally got the team to finish my last dance.

I joined the same contest in 2021 and 2022 as a leader of another team but only got an Honorable Mention Prize and a Successful Participant Prize respectively. It's acceptable for readers to say that it is OK when we get the H award, but it is devastating to receive the S award 1 year later as it can be taken as nothing. To protect myself and my teammates from similar stories, I stayed at school for additional days after the final exams and the term they terminated. Libraries across Xi'an were hot places I visited at that time only in pursuit of more tips when writing the solution papers.

The contest started near the Lunar New Year, the time when I had been home already due to conventions. The youngsters kept in touch with me online so I could reach them to clarify some confusions regarding details they had given in their analysis outputs. We sent our solutions 12 hours earlier than required, and we, later on, stayed tuned to the results.

The results are scheduled to be announced on May 10th, 2024, but we received the results a week earlier. All of us are excited to win the Meritorious Winner Award this year, as they are the first time to be participants and I find myself progressive. It was a remarkable moment, and I want to express my gratitude to my teammate and, of course, the roommate who introduced me to the team. It would be hard to strike out such a symphony without our joint efforts.

Feel free to take the paper as a reference.
